We will not be liable to you in any way if Our Site (or any part of it) is unavailable at any time and for any period.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2>4. Business Customers and Consumers</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>These Terms of Sale apply to business customers only. These Terms of Sale do not apply to individual consumers purchasing Paid Content for personal use (that is, not in connection with, or for use in, their trade, business, craft, or profession). For the avoidance of doubt, employees of IT services companies, contractors, consultants and sole traders are business customers.</li>
        <li>These Terms of Sale constitute the entire agreement between Us and you with respect to your purchase of Subscriptions and Paid Content from Us. You acknowledge that you have not relied upon any statement, representation, warranty, assurance, or promise made by or on behalf of Us that is not set out in these Terms of Sale and that you shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based upon any statement herein.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions, Paid Content, Pricing and Availability</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We may from time to time change Our prices. Changes in price will not affect any Subscription that you have already purchased but will apply to any subsequent renewal or new Subscription. We will inform you of any change in price at least 30 days before the change is due to take effect. If you do not agree to such a change, you may cancel the Contract as described in sub-Clause 11.1.</li>
        <li>Minor changes may, from time to time, be made to certain Paid Content, for example, to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, or to address technical or security issues. These changes will not alter the main characteristics of the Paid Content and should not normally affect your use of that Paid Content. However, if any change is made that would affect your use of the Paid Content, suitable information will be provided to you.</li>
        <li>In some cases, as described in the relevant content descriptions, We may also make more significant changes to the Paid Content. If We do so, We will inform you at least 30 days before the changes are due to take effect. If you do not agree to the changes, you may cancel the Contract as described in sub-Clause 11.1.</li>
        <li>Where any updates are made to Paid Content, that Paid Content will continue to match Our description of it as provided to you before you purchased your Subscription to access the Paid Content. Please note that this does not prevent Us from enhancing the Paid Content, thereby going beyond the original description.</li>
        <li>We make all reasonable efforts to ensure that all prices shown on Our Site are correct at the time of going online. Changes in price will not affect any order that you have already placed (please note sub-Clause 5.9 regarding VAT, however).</li>
        <li>All prices are checked by Us before We accept your order. In the unlikely event that We have shown incorrect pricing information, We will contact you in writing to inform you of the mistake. If the correct price is lower than that shown when you made your order, We will simply charge you the lower amount and continue processing your order. If the correct price is higher, We will give you the option to purchase the Subscription at the correct price or to cancel your order (or the affected part of it). We will not proceed with processing your order in this case until you respond. If We do not receive a response from you within 14 days, We will treat your order as cancelled and notify you of this in writing.</li>
        <li>If We discover an error in the price or description of your Subscription after your order is processed, We will inform you immediately and make all reasonable efforts to correct the error. You may, however, have the right to cancel the Contract if this happens. If We inform you of such an error and you do wish to cancel the Contract, please refer to sub-Clause 11.4.</li>
        <li>If the price of a Subscription that you have ordered changes between your order being placed and Us processing that order and taking payment, you will be charged the price shown on Our Site at the time of placing your order. Subsequent Subscriptions [and renewals] will be charged at the new price.</li>
        <li>Prices on Our Sites are shown exclusive of Tax. If the Tax rate changes between your order being placed and Us taking payment, the amount of Tax payable will be automatically adjusted when taking payment.</li>
        <li>Special offer prices offered as part of an affiliate agreement with a third party organisation are valid for the term of your membership or business arrangement with our Affiliate. Should you cancel your membership or business arrangement with our Affiliate, Prices will revert to current standard prices for the remainder of the subscription period.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>6. Orders: How Contracts Are Formed</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Our Site will guide you through the process of purchasing a Subscription. Before completing your purchase, you will be given the opportunity to review your order and amend it. Please ensure that you have checked your order carefully before submitting it.</li>
        <li>If, during the order process, you provide Us with incorrect or incomplete information, please contact Us as soon as possible. If We are unable to process your order due to incorrect or incomplete information, We will contact you to ask you to correct it. If you do not give Us the accurate or complete information within a reasonable time of Our request, We will cancel your order and treat the Contract as being at an end. If We incur any costs as a result of your incorrect or incomplete information, We may pass those costs on to you.</li>
        <li>No part of Our Site constitutes a contractual offer capable of acceptance. Your order to purchase a Subscription constitutes a contractual offer that We may, at Our sole discretion, accept. Our acceptance is indicated by Us sending you a Subscription Confirmation by email. Only once We have sent you a Subscription Confirmation will there be a legally binding Contract between Us and you.</li>
        <li>Subscription Confirmations shall contain the following information:
            <ul>
                <li>Your Subscription ID;</li>
                <li>Confirmation of the Subscription ordered including full details of the main characteristics of the Subscription and Paid Content available as part of it;</li>
                <li>Fully itemised pricing including, where appropriate, taxes, delivery and other additional charges;</li>
                <li>Commencement date of the Subscription; and</li>
                <li>Confirmation of your acknowledgement that the Paid Content will be made available to you immediately and that you will lose your legal right to change your mind and cancel upon accessing the Paid Content as detailed below in sub-Clause 11.1.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If We, for any reason, do not accept or cannot fulfil your order, no payment shall be taken under normal circumstances. If We have taken payment in such circumstances, such sums will be refunded to you as soon as possible and in any event within 14 days.</li>
        <li>Any refunds due under this Clause 6 will be made using the same payment method that you used when purchasing your Subscription.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>7. Payment</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Payment for Subscriptions must always be made in advance. Your chosen payment method will be charged when We process your order and send you a Subscription Confirmation (this usually occurs immediately and you will be shown a message confirming your payment).</li>
        <li>We accept the following methods of payment on Our Site:
            <ul>
                <li>Credit Card</li>
                <li>Debit Card</li>
                <li>PayPal</li>
                <li>Other methods as indicated on Our Site</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you do not make any payment due to Us on time, We may suspend your access to the Paid Content. If you do not make payment within 14 days of Our reminder, We may cancel the Contract. Any outstanding sums due to Us will remain due and payable.</li>
        <li>If you believe that We have charged you an incorrect amount, please contact Us as soon as reasonably possible to let Us know. You will not be charged for Paid Content while availability is suspended.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>8. Provision of Paid Content</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Paid Content appropriate to your Subscription will be available to you immediately when We send you a Subscription Confirmation and will continue to be available for the duration of your Subscription (including any renewals), or until the Contract is otherwise ended.</li>
        <li>In some limited circumstances, We may need to suspend the provision of Paid Content (in full or in part) to fix technical problems, make minor technical changes, update the Paid Content to comply with relevant changes in the law or other regulatory requirements, or to make more significant changes to the Paid Content, including the addition or removal of content. Unless the issue is urgent or an emergency, We will inform you in advance by email or via a notice on Our Site before suspending Paid Content.</li>
        <li>If We need to suspend availability of the Paid Content for longer than 14 days, We will extend your Subscription by a period equivalent to the length of the suspension (unless the suspension was due to your breach of these Terms of Sale or Our Website Terms of Use). If the suspension lasts (or We tell you that it is going to last) for more than 30 days, you may end the Contract as described below in sub-Clause 11.2.</li>
        <li>Any refunds due under this Clause 8 will be made using the same payment method that you used when purchasing your Subscription.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>9. Licence</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>When you purchase a Subscription to access Paid Content, We will grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to access, participate in and use the relevant Paid Content for your business purposes. The licence granted to you does not give you any rights in Our Paid Content (including any material that We may licence from third parties).</li>
        <li>The licence granted to you is subject to the following usage restrictions and/or permissions:
            <ul>
                <li>You may not copy, rent, sell, publish, republish, share, broadcast or otherwise transmit the Paid Content (or any part of it) or make it available to the public or to any third party except as permitted by these Terms of Sale or as required by law.</li>
                <li>You may not use any part of the Paid Content in connection with any business or commercial enterprise other than your own business.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>10. Ending Your Subscription</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You may cancel your Subscription at any time, however, subject to sub-Clause 11.4 and Clause 12, We cannot offer any refunds and you will continue to have access to the Paid Content for the remainder of your current Subscription (up until the renewal or expiry date, as applicable), whereupon the Contract will end.</li>
        <li>If you purchase a Subscription by mistake (or allow your Subscription to renew by mistake), please contact Us as soon as possible and no later than 14 days after the Subscription starts or renews. Provided you have not accessed any Paid Content during that time, We will cancel the Subscription and issue a full refund. If you have accessed any Paid Content during that time, We cannot offer a refund and you will continue to have access to the Paid Content for the remainder of your current Subscription (up until the renewal or expiry date, as applicable), whereupon the Contract will end.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>11. Ending the Contract</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You may end the Contract at any time if We have informed you of a forthcoming change to your Subscription or these Terms of Sale that you do not agree to, or if We have informed you of an error in the price or description of your Subscription or the Paid Content and you do not wish to proceed.</li>
        <li>If We have suspended availability of the Paid Content for more than 30 days, or We have told you that We are going to suspend availability for more than 30 days, you may end the Contract immediately.</li>
        <li>If you end the Contract for any of the reasons set out in this Clause 11, We will refund you in full for any Paid Content that you have paid for but not received.</li>
        <li>If you end the Contract for any other reason, We will not refund any sums paid by you for Paid Content.</li>
    </ol>
