4. Business Customers and Consumers

4.1          These Terms of Sale apply to business customers only.  These Terms of Sale do not apply to individual consumers purchasing Paid Content for personal use (that is, not in connection with, or for use in, their trade, business, craft, or profession). For the avoidance of doubt, employees of IT services companies, contractors, consultants and sole traders are business customers.

You acknowledge that you have not relied upon any statement, representation, warranty, assurance, or promise made by or on behalf of Us that is not set out in these Terms of Sale and that you shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based upon any statement herein.

 5. Subscriptions, Paid Content, Pricing and Availability

5.1          We may from time to time change Our prices.  Changes in price will not affect any Subscription that you have already purchased but will apply to any subsequent renewal or new Subscription.  We will inform you of any change in price at least 30 days before the change is due to take effect.  If you do not agree to such a change, you may cancel the Contract as described in sub-Clause 11.1.

5.2          Minor changes may, from time to time, be made to certain Paid Content, for example, to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, or to address technical or security issues.  These changes will not alter the main characteristics of the Paid Content and should not normally affect your use of that Paid Content.  However, if any change is made that would affect your use of the Paid Content, suitable information will be provided to you.

5.3          In some cases, as described in the relevant content descriptions, We may also make more significant changes to the Paid Content.  If We do so, We will inform you at least 30 days before the changes are due to take effect.  If you do not agree to the changes, you may cancel the Contract as described in sub-Clause 11.1.

5.4          Where any updates are made to Paid Content, that Paid Content will continue to match Our description of it as provided to you before you purchased your Subscription to access the Paid Content.  Please note that this does not prevent Us from enhancing the Paid Content, thereby going beyond the original description.

5.5          We make all reasonable efforts to ensure that all prices shown on Our Site are correct at the time of going online. Changes in price will not affect any order that you have already placed (please note sub-Clause 5.9 regarding VAT, however).

5.6          All prices are checked by Us before We accept your order.  In the unlikely event that We have shown incorrect pricing information, We will contact you in writing to inform you of the mistake.  If the correct price is lower than that shown when you made your order, We will simply charge you the lower amount and continue processing your order.  If the correct price is higher, We will give you the option to purchase the Subscription at the correct price or to cancel your order (or the affected part of it).  We will not proceed with processing your order in this case until you respond.  If We do not receive a response from you within 14 days, We will treat your order as cancelled and notify you of this in writing.

5.7          If We discover an error in the price or description of your Subscription after your order is processed, We will inform you immediately and make all reasonable efforts to correct the error.  You may, however, have the right to cancel the Contract if this happens.  If We inform you of such an error and you do wish to cancel the Contract, please refer to sub-Clause 11.4.

5.8          If the price of a Subscription that you have ordered changes between your order being placed and Us processing that order and taking payment, you will be charged the price shown on Our Site at the time of placing your order.  Subsequent Subscriptions [and renewals] will be charged at the new price.

5.9          Prices on Our Sites are shown exclusive of Tax.  If the Tax rate changes between your order being placed and Us taking payment, the amount of Tax payable will be automatically adjusted when taking payment.

5.10       Special offer prices offered as part of an affiliate agreement with a third party organisation are valid for the term of your membership or business arrangement with our Affiliate. Should you cancel your membership or business arrangement with our Affiliate, Prices will revert to current standard prices for the remainder of the subscription period.

We will not be responsible for any delay in the availability of Paid Content that results from you providing incorrect or incomplete information.
